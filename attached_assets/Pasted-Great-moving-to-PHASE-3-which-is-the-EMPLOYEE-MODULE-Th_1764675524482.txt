Great — moving to PHASE 3, which is the EMPLOYEE MODULE.

This is the biggest and most important part of the entire GMS system because it includes:

✔ Employee Profile
✔ Attendance (GPS + Web)
✔ Targets
✔ Tasks
✔ Announcements
✔ Expense Claims
✔ Self Location Attendance

I will break Phase 3 into simple, clear steps so even a non-developer can follow everything.

⭐ PHASE 3 — EMPLOYEE MODULE (Master Module)

This phase includes 6 Major Sub-Modules:

1️⃣ Employee Profile
2️⃣ Attendance System
3️⃣ Target System
4️⃣ Task Management System
5️⃣ Announcements System
6️⃣ Expense Claim System

We will build them one by one, starting with database → API → UI.

🌟 STEP 1 — EMPLOYEE MODULE OVERVIEW

Each employee will have:

Personal details

Job details

Reporting manager

Location access

Permissions (based on role)

Employees connect to all other modules:
✔ Attendance → daily login
✔ Tasks → assigned by manager
✔ Targets → performance
✔ Claims → expenses
✔ Announcements → communication

So this module is the core of everything.

🌟 STEP 2 — EMPLOYEE DATABASE STRUCTURE

We will create these tables:

✔ 1. employees

Stores all employee profile details.

Field	Type	Notes
id	int	primary key
user_id	int	linked to users table
emp_code	string	unique code
department	string	HR / Sales / etc
designation	string	job title
reporting_manager	int	employee_id of manager
joining_date	date	
salary	number	optional
status	active/inactive	
✔ 2. attendance

For daily check-in/out + GPS.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| employee_id | int | |
| check_in | datetime | |
| check_in_lat | decimal | |
| check_in_lng | decimal | |
| check_out | datetime | |
| check_out_lat | decimal | |
| check_out_lng | decimal | |

✔ 3. targets

Employee performance targets.

| Field | Type |
| employee_id | int |
| title | string |
| description | string |
| target_value | number |
| achieved_value | number |
| period | daily/weekly/monthly |

✔ 4. tasks

Assigned tasks.

| title | description | assigned_to | assigned_by |
| due_date | status | priority |

✔ 5. announcements

Messages visible to employees.

| Field | Type |
| audience | all / department / single employee |

✔ 6. expense_claims

Employees submit expenses.

| Field | Type |
| amount | number |
| category | travel/food/other |
| status | pending/approved/rejected |
| approved_by | manager |

🌟 STEP 4 — UI PAGES FOR EMPLOYEE MODULE

I will later generate all pages like:

/employees/create
/employees/:id
/employees/attendance
/employees/tasks
/employees/targets
/employees/claims
/announcements


All UI will be:

clean

table-based

easy navigation

shadcn UI components

🌟 STEP 5 — APIS FOR EMPLOYEE MODULE

We will create APIs:

✔ Employees
POST /api/employees/create
GET /api/employees
GET /api/employees/:id
PATCH /api/employees/:id

✔ Attendance
POST /api/attendance/checkin
POST /api/attendance/checkout
GET /api/attendance/report
